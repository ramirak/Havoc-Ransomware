## Information

- The ransomware will encrypt the path given to it, currently 'important_docs' folder
- Watch how all those precious academic articles get destroyed :D
- This is of course only demonstration, but at this moment you will get a ransomware note on your desktop. 
- The note will tell you to either pay or lose all access to your important documents / Photos.
- Most of the time you will be presented with new desktop background to make it a little more scary :D
- Attackers will most probably refer you for buying crypto currencies and pay to the presented wallet ID.
- There is no guarantee that you will ever get the key to decrypt your data!!
- Most of the time there is also no way of decrypting the data without the key.
- Backup your data occasionaly to prevent this from happening to you for real!
- Use known anti-virus vendor and keep it updated to lower the risk of getting infected.
